## Frameworks

Framework is the backbone of any web app. Choosing the right framework is critically important. In this section, there will be list of famous Node.js frameworks and comparison of their features. By understanding the feature and philosophy of each framework, developer can pick the framework that matches business requirement and team profile.

Below is curated list of well-known and tested Node.js frameworks suitable for bulding REST API. Github repository and documentation links are available for further inquiry. Each framework also has information about its opinion paradigm. It is a simple measure of how a framework forces development in specific way. 

On one end, there is ***opinionated*** framework where the it defines the *right* way to create controller, validate inputs, logging, handle errors, etc. On the other end, there is ***unopinionated*** one where it defines limited functions to handle basics like requests, response, routing, etc, while developer is expected to solve the rest (which is the reason to make this guide). There is also middle ground I personally called ***moderate*** where there is recommended approach for development, but the framework provides extra feature as *optional* plugin.

No paradigm is better than the others. Opinionated framework reduces time spent for setting configs and finding packages, as well as make development faster and more structured. Unopinionated framework allows developer to choose most suitable packages for specific use case, which is more agile. Also, when performed correctly, it will yield better performance.
### Framework Details
| Name | Description | Opinion Paradigm | Documentation | Github |
| --- | --------------------- | ----- | ---- | ----|

- [firebase]() : 
- 
### Router 🚏
Router is must-have feature for REST API service. It basically map request URL to a controller, and bring relevant data along.
- [koa-router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/koa-router) : router middleware for Koa framework
  
### Database Driver 🛢
REST API service may need to store or access data from database. Use library below to enable Node.js to connect to specific database. Also, note that some frameworks offer built-in driver.
- [cassandra-driver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cassandra-driver) : Node.js client library for Apache Cassandra and DSE using Cassandra's binary protocol and Cassandra Query Language.

### ORM 🗺
ORM is an abstraction layer between Node.js and database. It serves as data model definition, data caching, query builder, input sanitizer, and adapter for various databases, among others. 

Developers have divided [opinions about ORM](https://medium.com/@mithunsasidharan/should-i-or-should-i-not-use-orm-4c3742a639ce). Some love it ❤️, some hate it💢. There are trade-offs:
- ORM has some learning curve
- ORM makes writing complex query cumbersome
- ORM makes code shorter
- ORM makes data model consistent with database constraints
- ORM caches data and reduce loan on database
One key takeaway: ORM is valuable for common REST API service with simple query access (e.g CRUD). 

Interested in using ORM? Check out top-rated ORM packages below.
- [knex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex) : A batteries-included, multi-dialect query builder for Node.js.

- [waterline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/waterline) : Next-generation storage and retrieval engine, and the default ORM used in the Sails framework. Supports MySQL, MongoDB, neDB, and PostgreSQL.
### Request validation ⭕️
Under no circumstances a REST API could fully trust user's input. Invalid input may lead to an error that bring the service down, or worse, an injection attack with catastrophic consequences. That's why validation (including sanitation) is important in any REST API workflow. Check awesome validation packages available below.
- [express-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-validator) : A validator middleware for Express framework, inspired by validator.js.
- [joi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi) : The (self-proclaimed) most powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript.
- [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) : A library of string validators and sanitizers.
### Rate Limit 🚦
Rate limit is feature of allowing limited number of request per period per IP address/token. For example, user can only send 1000 requests per day, and only 1 request per 10 second is allowed. Otherwise, server will send `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP response. It is useful feature when a REST API service has daily/monthly quota, or serve as security measure to prevent attacks. 
- [@nestjs/throttler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nestjs/throttler) : A Rate-Limiter for NestJS, regardless of the context.

- [serve-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static) : Static file serving middleware for Express framework or an.
### File upload 🖼
Some REST API services need capability to receive file as input. Note that file upload With packages below, it is possible.
- [busboy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/busboy) : A node.js module for parsing incoming HTML form data.
- [formidable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formidable) : A Node.js module for parsing form data, especially file uploads.
- [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) : Node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files.
### Multimedia file 🎞
### HTTP client 📡
REST API receives request and send response through HTTP/HTTPS protocol. But what if the server needs to talk to other services while processing request? HTTP client is the answer. Here is the list of well-known packages.
- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) : Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [bent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bent) : Functional HTTP client for Node.js and Browsers with async/await. Incredibly small browser version built on fetch with no external dependencies or polyfills.

### Middleware 🏃
### Logging 📃
Many things happen inside a REST API service. In many cases, it is important to know when exactly something happens, written as records. It can be helpful for tracking errors, tracing fraud, or serving as data source for further analysis. That is the job of logging feature, and you can find suitable one for your project here.
- [bunyan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bunyan) : A simple and fast JSON logging library for node.js services:

### Testing 🧐
Testing is important part of development to make sure REST API service works as expected and can handle errors gracefully. For REST API, it is recommended to focus on unit testing and integration testing. Component testing, which is important for front-end, is not a concern here.
- [ava](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava) : Test runner for Node.js with a concise API, detailed error output, embrace of new language features and process isolation that lets you develop with confidence 🚀
